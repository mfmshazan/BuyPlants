## ✅ Changes Made

All email notification functionality has been completely removed from the BuyPlants project.

### Current State
- ✅ Signup/login works normally (no email sent)

## 📋 What Still Works

All core features remain functional:
- ✅ User signup/login

## 🎯 Summary

The email notification system has been completely removed. The website now works without any email functionality. Users can still sign up and use all features - they just won't receive welcome emails, and admins won't receive signup notifications.
